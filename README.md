# Associated Press Website Layout React App

A React app, hosted on [Netlify](https://nbaldzhiev-ap-layout.netlify.app/), to practice React, HTML, and CSS The website's sole purpose is to practice FE development. It tries to replicate the layout of the [Associated Press homepage](https://apnews.com/) (as of June 2022) as a way to practice React, React Router and layout construction with CSS Grid and Flexbox. The React app is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This project is used to practice React, React Router and CSS Grid + Flexbox. The app replicates the layout of the Associated Press homepage, which is a news site. Since news APIs tend to be paid, I decided to use the [Pexesl API](https://www.pexels.com/api/) to get different thumbnail photos. The titles of the "news" stories are taken from the photographs' descriptions.

The website is somewhat responsive with a single breakpoint at max-width 768px to allow for better rendering on smartphones.

> **_NOTE:_**  This project is not free of bugs and this is normal for this type of a project used for learning purposes. Fixing these bugs is part of my path towards learning news things.
